#------------------------------------------------------------------
# We group observables into blocks according to type of observable
# for convenience, e.g. {type}: {observable}_{experiment}
#
# For each observable, we include its specific cuts in its block
#
# In the analysis code, we will store observables in a dictionary,
# labeled as: {type}_{observable}_{experiment}_{suffix}
# For example: hadron_pt_cms
#              jet_mass_alice_R0.2
# where the optional suffix is only present when needed.
#
# We compute each observable only if it lies in the specified centrality range.
# We include all available centralities up to 50% centrality, at present.
#
# We include hepdata file paths when appropriate (relative to JETSCAPE-analysis directory),
# to be used for histogram binning (via hepdata histogram) and plotting (via hepdata tgraph).
#   - Note that the pp hepdata files contain distributions, while the AA hepdata files contain RAA ratios.
#   - Note that we bin pp observables according to the binning in each AA centrality;
#     the pp hepdata tgraphs are included only for QA.
#
# The histogram binnings are determined from: plot_results_STAT_utils.bins_from_config()
#   - The hepdata_AA dir/hname fields need to have either:
#     (i) list of dirs, with single hname
#     (ii) list of hnames, with single dir
#     where the list corresponds to the centrality list in the config block.
#   - The AA binnings are always used, since we ultimately want to form PbPb/pp ratios
#
# The data TGraphs are determined from: plot_results_STAT_utils.tgraph_from_hepdata()
#   - For pp: The hepdata_pp dir/gname should have only a single entry for dir/gname -- not a list.
#             Unless on rare occasion the pp data with different binnings for each centrality
#             are available (e.g. 5.02 TeV inclusive_jet_pt_cms)
#   - For AA: The hepdata_AA dir/gname should follow the same list convention as the dir/hname specified above.
#
# Note that for the inputs to the likelihood calculation, we use the Pb-Pb/pp ratios, rather
# than the Pb-Pb and pp distributions themselves. This choice is intended to minimize dependence
# on the pp baseline, although may be susceptible to shape effects from the distributions themselves;
# one could consider to investigate the magnitude of these effects in the future.
#
# Note that when using these experimental data for the Bayesian calibration, we need to
# revisit the treatment/breakdown of uncertainties and construct a covariance matrix
# for each measurement (close attention was not paid during the event generation QA stage).
#
# Jan 2022: All kinematics/settings checked by Peter Jacobs -- all are validated unless
#           noted otherwise with "TODO"
