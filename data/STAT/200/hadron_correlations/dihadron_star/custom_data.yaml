# This custom data is constructed from the HEPdata file since we need to translate
# from N_part back to centrality for a comparison between simulations and data
#
# The pt associated index is mapped as follows:
# 0: 3 < pt_assoc < 4 (we exclude this bin to avoid inflating the size of the skim with background contamination)
# 1: 4 < pt_assoc < 6
# 2: 6 < pt_assoc (in practice, the upper limit is 1000, but this is just a coding convention)
#
# The name is formatted as:
# data_{collision_system}_{NS,AS}_ptAssoc{index}
#
# The data are stored as a function of centrality:
# [0,5], [5, 10], [10, 20], [20, 30], [30, 40]
# NOTE on repetition:
# However, we then copy the data (once for each centrality bin) so that we can plot the same comparison
# (as a function of centrality) for each single centrality bin where we extract the data.
# Basically, since there's a single value per centrality, we just say that each data point will compare against
# all centrality bins. It's redundant, but simpler.
#
# NOTE: The systematic uncertainties are negligible for pt_assoc > 4 (which is where we concern ourselves),
#       so we disregard the systematics and only extract the statistical uncertainties
