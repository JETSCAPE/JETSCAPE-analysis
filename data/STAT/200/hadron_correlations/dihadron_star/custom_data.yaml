# This custom data is constructed from the HEPdata file since we need to translate
# from N_part back to centrality for a comparison between simulations and data
#
# The pt trigger and pt associated name is encoded into each section
# The data are stored as a function of centrality:
# [0,5], [5, 10], [10, 20], [20, 30], [30, 40]
#
# Since it is difficult in the current framework to create separate near-side and
# away-side plots, we instead encode them into one plot. So the first 5 bins contain
# the near-side yields (5 bins because there are 5 centrality bins), and then the next
# 5 bins contain the away-side yields.
#
# NOTE on repetition:
# We then copy the data 5 times, creating identical copies for each centrality bin.
# This way, we can use the centrality index in the framework. For each comparison,
# we will plot the data against all of the centrality points, but only two data points
# will be populated (one for the near-side, and one for the away-side).
# Basically, since there's a single value per centrality, we just say that each data
# point will compare against all centrality bins. It's redundant, but simpler.
#
# NOTE: The systematic uncertainties are negligible for pt_assoc > 4 (which is where we
#       concern ourselves), so we disregard the systematics and only extract the
#       statistical uncertainties
